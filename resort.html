                  <h2>About the experience</h2>
                  <article>Going to Chikmagalur for the first time we were not sure on our stay over there. One of my friend suggested me this resort. After searching on internet and checking the reviews we decided to hit this resort. Initially I was little skeptical about the resort cause I had some real bad experiences with previous resorts in other places. However after spending 2 days in the resort I can say this was the best experience we all had. We went a month back. It was saturday and we reached at around 1 PM.The place is located near to kallathi falls , 1 hour from chikmagalur town.The place location is awesome and it is well maintained. It is clean and surrounded by greenery. So a day package includes breakfast , lunch and dinner , bonfire and snacks from time to time. The place has cottages having double to triple beds. There are other amenities like carrom, chess board, table tennis which are free to use. The best part is the bonfire place .There are provisions of music system. You can party there with the group . They are even planning to get a snooker table by the end of this year. If there is a power cut , you can get a quick generator service. The hospitality is too good. Anything you ask for they would come with</article>
